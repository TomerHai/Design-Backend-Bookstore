You have been assigned the task of developing the backend for a serverless book inventory management system using AWS managed services. 
The system will enable a bookstore to efficiently manage their book catalog and streamline operations. 
As an intermediate software developer, your role is to design, implement, and deploy the backend system using Terraform, focusing on serverless architecture, DynamoDB, and other relevant managed services.
# Requirements
1.	Design and implement a serverless backend system that allows the bookstore to effectively manage their book inventory and related operations.
2.	Utilize DynamoDB as the primary data store for the book inventory. Design the DynamoDB tables to store book information efficiently, considering the required attributes such as ISBN, title, author, publication date, and description.
3.	Implement AWS Lambda functions to handle the business logic and interactions with DynamoDB. The Lambda functions should facilitate book creation, retrieval, updates, and deletions, following a RESTful API design.
4.	Design and implement a secure and scalable RESTful API using AWS API Gateway. The API should provide endpoints for the bookstore staff to interact with the Lambda functions and perform book inventory management tasks.
5.	Secure the API endpoints using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies. Ensure that only authorized users with appropriate credentials can access the API and perform book inventory management operations.
6.	Implement authentication and authorization using AWS Cognito. Bookstore staff should be able to sign in with their credentials and obtain access tokens to securely interact with the system.
7.	Enable efficient storage and retrieval of book cover images using AWS S3. Implement functionality to upload book cover images and associate them with the respective book records in DynamoDB.
8.	Implement error handling and provide appropriate feedback to users in case of any issues or validation errors during book inventory management operations.
9.	Leverage other relevant AWS managed services, such as CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and alerting, and AWS Secrets Manager for securely storing sensitive information.
10.	Use Terraform to define and provision the necessary AWS resources for the backend system. Create Terraform scripts/modules to deploy the DynamoDB tables, Lambda functions, API Gateway, IAM roles, and other required resources.
11.	Prepare comprehensive documentation that includes the system architecture, design decisions, deployment steps, and Terraform configuration. This will enable future maintenance, enhancement, and deployment of the system.
# Deliverables
1.	Code repository containing the source code and Terraform scripts/modules for the serverless book inventory management system backend.
2.	Detailed documentation explaining the system architecture, design decisions, deployment steps, and Terraform configuration.
3.	Instructions on how to set up and use the backend system, including any prerequisites or configuration requirements.
4.	Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the backend system.
5.	Demonstrate the deployed system during the interview, showcasing the ability to perform book inventory management operations through API calls.
NOTE: Focus on designing, implementing, and deploying the backend system using Terraform, ensuring it meets the requirements of a scalable, secure, and efficient book inventory management system.
User interface implementation is not necessary for this task.
